"Attention" is a song recorded and produced by American singer-songwriter Charlie Puth for his second studio album Voicenotes (2018). It was written by Puth and Jacob Kasher. A midtempo pop rock track with elements of 1980s soft-soul and funk music, the song finds Puth singing about how he realizes his partner was "just want[ing] attention" from him instead of loving him.
